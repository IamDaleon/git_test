        “Lash extensions are semi-permanent synthetic, faux mink or silk fibers
        which are applied strand by strand to your natural lashes,” explains
        Richardson. As you might expect, the application is fairly tedious. “The
        extensions are carefully applied one at a time using a
        specially-formulated,
        <span style="color: blue">
          semi-permanent glue that will not irritate or damage the natural
          lash</span
        >,” she adds. <br /><br />

        Unlike false eyelashes, where the strip or individual lashes are applied
        to the skin, lash extensions are attached directly to the lash itself.
        The results are more lush, dense lashes that may even let you skip
        mascara 😯.
